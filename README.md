#  E-Commerce Product Recommendation System

**Project by: Nafisa Begam**

---

##  Project Overview

This is a product recommendation system I built using an e-commerce transaction dataset. It uses item-based collaborative filtering and cosine similarity to recommend similar products based on users‚Äô past purchase behavior.  

The idea behind this project was to gain hands-on experience with real-world e-commerce data and develop a practical recommendation engine.

##  Features

- Cleaned and processed raw e-commerce transaction data
- Created a user-item interaction matrix from historical transaction events
- Calculated item-item similarity using cosine similarity
- Developed a simple yet effective item-based recommendation system
- Built an interactive Streamlit web app to deliver live product recommendations
- Compiled a complete project report documenting the workflow and results

Note:  
The dataset files (`events.csv`, `item_properties_part1.csv`, `category_tree.csv`) were too large to upload directly to GitHub via browser. They are available on request or can be accessed directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset).
